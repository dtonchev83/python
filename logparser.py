#Task description:
#Please write a script in python or bash to parse a standard Linux /var/log/messages (or syslog) log 
#file and search for any IP addresses.
#For each unique IP address, the script should output the IP address, itâ€™s hostname (if resolvable), the time of the log, and if it is still active on the network.
#End of task description.


#using python 3.8, script will match ipv4 addresses only.
